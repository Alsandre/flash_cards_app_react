- **Database Entities**: 5 entities with proper indexing and relationships
- **React Components**: 15+ reusable UI and business components
- **Zustand Store Slices**: 4 fully implemented state management slices
- **Repository Classes**: 4 repositories following consistent pattern

### 🏗️ Architecture Patterns Implemented

#### Repository Pattern

```typescript
interface Repository<T> {
  findAll(): Promise<T[]>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<T | null>;
  create(entity: Omit<T, "id">): Promise<T>;
  update(id: string, updates: Partial<T>): Promise<T>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### Zustand Store Structure

- **UI Slice**: Theme, routing, loading states, error handling
- **Group Slice**: Group CRUD operations with repository integration
- **Card Slice**: Card CRUD operations with group association
- **Study Slice**: Session management, progress tracking, card rating

#### Component Hierarchy

```
App (ErrorBoundary)
├── AppLayout (Navigation, Theme)
├── Pages (Dashboard, GroupDetail, StudySession, etc.)
├── Forms (GroupForm, CardForm with validation)
├── UI Components (Button, Card, Input, LoadingSpinner)
└── Study Components (StudyErrorBoundary)
```

## Current Capabilities

### Functional Features

1. **Group Management**

   - Create groups with configurable study session size
   - Edit group names and descriptions
   - Delete groups with confirmation
   - View all groups in dashboard

2. **Card Management**

   - Add cards with front/back content and optional hints
   - Edit existing cards with form validation
   - Delete individual cards
   - View all cards within group context
