**ISSUE WITH INTEGRATED TERMINAL**
- terminal does not work properly
- when generating a command that writes output to a file `terminal.txt` then read the file to get the output
- always use the `terminal.txt` file to get the output of the command
- terminal.txt content should not be overwritten unless user explicitly purges it
