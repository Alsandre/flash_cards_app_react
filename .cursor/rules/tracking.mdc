# Progress Tracking Rule

This rule enforces the progress tracking workflow defined in `progress_tracking.yml`.

## Core Directive

**ALWAYS follow the workflow defined in `.cursor/rules/progress_tracking.yml`**

The detailed progress tracking rules are maintained in `progress_tracking.yml` which defines:

- Session start procedures (read progress.yml → verify foundation alignment → identify next task)
- Development workflow (update progress → log decisions → flag foundation updates)
- Task completion procedures (mark complete → update metrics → unlock dependencies)
- Session end procedures (set next context → sync foundation if needed)

## Recovery Protocol Check

**FIRST ACTION**: Before any development work, check for recovery needs:

1. **Read progress.yml** - Check for blockers, interrupted tasks, or error states
2. **Verify environment** - Check for system/dependency issues from previous session
3. **Resume or recover** - Handle any incomplete or failed operations
4. **Update progress** - Log recovery actions taken

## Quick Reference

1. **Session Start**: Recovery check → Read `progress.yml` → Verify foundation alignment
2. **During Work**: Update progress incrementally, log all decisions
3. **Task Complete**: Mark complete only when acceptance criteria met
4. **Session End**: Set clear context for next session

## Authority Chain

`progress.yml` → `flashcard_demo_v1.md` → existing code

The progress document is the single source of truth for current development state.

Refer to `progress_tracking.yml` for complete workflow specifications and behavioral rules.
